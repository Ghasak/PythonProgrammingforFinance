# Company correlation table
## - Python Programming for Finance p.9

Hello and welcome to part 9 of the Python for Finance tutorial series. In the previous tutorials, we've covered how to pull in stock pricing data for a large number of companies, how to combine that data into one large dataset, and how to visually represent at least one relationship between all of the companies. Now, we're going to try to take this data and do some machine learning with it!

The idea is to see what might happen if we took data from all of the current companies, and fed this through some sort of machine learning classifier. We know that, over time, various companies have different relationships with eachother, so, if the machine can recognize and fit these relationships, it's possible we could predict from changes in prices today, what will happen tomorrow with a specific company. Let's try!

# Output
To Run this in terminal use

```
python Projectfiles/P9_ProforFinanace.py
```
We will zoom into some companies to get:

# My Note
We will try to look on the movment of many companies together to get an edge knowledge. Take all the feature data and based on the feature to check the forecasting. We will create an algorithm to predict the next 7 days prices for each company and then decide based on a specific percentage of increasing/decreasing in prices to buy/sell the stock of this certain company.
